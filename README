wubi-move.sh
============

This is a bash script that migrates a Wubi install to a partition. The script is based on the wubi-move-to-partition script from Agostino Russo taken the Wubi Guide (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide).

The first version updated the wubi-move-to-partition script to correct a few problems and deprecated commands, as well as to update it to support Grub2. It only worked on Wubi installs from 9.10 and later.

This version adds the following features:
1. Supports migration of a normal (non-wubi) Ubuntu install. This can be useful to create a working backup, move your installation between computers, or create a working copy to experiment with.
2. Supports migration of a Wubi install from just the root.disk file (new option --root-disk= ). This can be performed from an Ubuntu live CD/USB or another Ubuntu install. The named root.disk must be a fully-contained, working Wubi install (this excludes grub-legacy Wubi where the /boot folder is always on the Windows partition).
3. It supports migration of a Wubi or Normal install that uses grub-legacy - however it will replace grub-legacy with Grub2 (only on the migrated install). It does not update the current install's menu.lst so it is recommended to always install the Grub2 bootloader (or modify menu.lst manually).
4. It has a new option --shared-swap to be used if you will be sharing an existing swap partition with another install. It bypasses the 'mkswap' command to avoid modifying the UUID.


Usage: sudo bash wubi-move.sh [OPTION] target_partition [swap_partition]
       e.g. sudo bash wubi-move.sh /dev/sda5 /dev/sda6

Migrate an ubuntu install (wubi or normal) to partition
  -h, --help              print this message and exit
  -v, --version           print the version information and exit
  --notes                 print the Assumptions and Notes, and exit
  --no-bootloader         do not install the grub2 bootloader
  --shared-swap           share swap partition with an existing install
  -y, --assume-yes        assume yes to all prompts
  --root-disk=<root.disk> Specify a root.disk file to migrate

Assumptions: 
  1. The script will detect automatically whether the current install
     to be migrated is a Wubi or normal install. 
  2. If you are running the script from a live CD/USB then the 
     --root-disk= option is required. The grub2 bootloader must be
     installed when using this option.
  3. The grub2 bootloader will be installed to /dev/sdX where /dev/sdXY
     is the target partition, unless --no-bootloader is specified.
     You will still be prompted whether to install the grub bootloader 
     unless option -y or --assume-yes is supplied.
  4. If the install being migrated contains grub-legacy it will be 
     replaced with Grub2 (only on the migrated install). You are not 
     required to install the Grub2 bootloader, however, if you choose
     not to then you will have to manually modify the menu.lst to boot
     the migrated install.
     NOTE: the grub2 installation takes control and requires user input
     on releases 9.10 and greater. It will also prompt for the bootloader
     install drive/partition.
  5. The target partition file system will be formatted as ext4 (default) 
     or ext3 if detected on the install being migrated. The script will not
     modify the partition type i.e. set it to 83 (linux)
  6. An install with separate /home, /boot, or /usr partitions or virtual
     disks will be merged when it is migrated onto the single target 
     partition and fstab modified accordingly.

Notes:
  If you install the grub bootloader, then the grub menu from your migrated
  install will be presented at boot - not the windows menu (for Wubi installs.)
  If you do not install the bootloader, then you will still be able to 
  boot the migrated install from the current install's Grub menu, unless your
  current install uses grub legacy.
  For Wubi users, make sure you install bootloader before uninstalling Wubi. 

  To install the bootloader manually, boot your new installation and run: 
       sudo grub-install /dev/sdX 
  (where X is the drive you boot from e.g. /dev/sda)

Recommended:
  Run "sudo update-grub" on the migrated install after booting the first time
